# Autonomous Machine Vision Robot

This contains the underlying code used as part of my MEng dissertation at Brunel University London, for the following group member:

Sanabil Qureshi
1713500

For the purposes of storage reduction (70GB -> 0.5GB), only the base scripts used to generate both the augmented images and all TensorFlow models analysed have been uploaded here. However, a sample model for each defect type has been provided in the live models folder.
